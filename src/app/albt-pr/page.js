             <p className="text-lg text-primaryText font-normal leading-[150%]">
              Certain statements contained in this press release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the 
              federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning 
              future events impacting the Company and therefore involve several risks and uncertainties. You can identify 
              these statements by the fact that they use words such as “will”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “should”, 
              “may”, and other words and terms of similar meaning or use of future dates; however, the absence of these 
              words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements 
              provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does 
              not directly relate to any historical or current fact, including statements regarding the ability to enter into 
              a definitive agreement, as well as the Company’s commercialization, distribution and sales of its products and 
              the ability to compete with other similar products. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated 
              by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors as disclosed in our filings with 
              the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), accessible through the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov), 
              including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K 
              filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes, and 
              results may differ materially because of more general factors, including (without limitation) general 
              industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public 
              policy changes. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the {`Company's`} 
              views as of the date of this press release and these views could change. The Company disclaims any 
              obligation to update forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be 
              relied upon as representing the {`Company's`} views as of any date subsequent to the date of the press 
              release. The contents of any website referenced in this press release are not incorporated by

        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          Promotional campaigns commonly result in short-lived spikes in stock price and volume, followed by rapid declines. These spikes are typically driven by retail speculation, promotional circulation, and momentary investor interest—not fundamentals. You should expect that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc text-base text-primaryText space-y-3 font-inter">
          <li>{`ALBT’s`} stock may increase temporarily during this promotion,</li>
          <li>Trading volume may rise sharply, and</li>
          <li>The price may fall after the campaign ends or selling begins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          These patterns are typical of stock promotions, and you should proceed accordingly.
