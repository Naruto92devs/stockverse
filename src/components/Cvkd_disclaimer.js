        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">IMPORTANT SUMMARY — PLEASE READ FIRST</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          This website and any affiliated digital materials are published by Relqo Media LLC, a Wyoming marketing agency that has been compensated in cash by Genesis One Holdings LLC to produce and distribute promotional content regarding Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CVKD). This communication is a paid advertisement, not a research report, not investment advice, and not an independent publication. Relqo Media is not a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or securities analyst.
          Investing in small-cap or microcap securities is extremely speculative and may result in the total loss of your investment. We strongly urge all viewers to consult a licensed investment professional and perform their own due diligence.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">1. NATURE AND INTENT OF THIS COMMUNICATION</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          Relqo Media LLC is a for-profit marketing agency engaged in paid promotions of public companies. The content we produce is strictly commercial and intended to create temporary public awareness, visibility, and short-term market activity around the featured company. This material is not impartial. All readers should interpret our content as a paid commercial advertisement and not as an editorial, research article, or independent commentary.
          We create advertisements, not analysis. These Communications are not intended to be factual evaluations of the company’s operations or investment merit.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">2. COMPENSATION FOR CADRENAL THERAPEUTICS, INC. (CVKD)</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          Relqo Media LLC has been retained by Genesis One Holdings LLC to provide promotional media services for Cadrenal Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CVKD). As of the effective date:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc text-base text-primaryText space-y-3 font-inter pl-8">
          <li>Relqo Media LLC is receiving cash compensation for digital investor awareness campaigns.</li>
          <li>The total compensation paid for these services is $25,000 per week, paid weekly, for the period beginning January 1, 2025 through July 1, 2025, totaling $650,000.</li>
          <li>Genesis One Holdings LLC may own, acquire, or dispose of shares in CVKD during or after the campaign period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          This relationship creates a material conflict of interest. Relqo Media’s content regarding CVKD should be considered promotional, biased, and financially motivated.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">3. INTENDED AUDIENCE</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          These Communications are directed solely to U.S.-based, self-directed investors who understand the risks of investing in microcap and Nasdaq-listed securities. The content is not intended for children, seniors, retirement accounts, or individuals with limited experience in securities trading. These Communications are not intended to guide investment for long-term portfolio management or financial planning purposes.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">4. NO ENDORSEMENT OR VERIFICATION OF COMPANY CLAIMS</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          Relqo Media LLC does not independently verify, investigate, or audit any statements made by the company being promoted, its officers, its press releases, or any third-party sources. Any claims, projections, customer announcements, or product statements made in connection with CVKD should be assumed to be unverified and potentially inaccurate unless independently confirmed.
          You should not rely on any statements regarding future performance, partnerships, revenue projections, or corporate plans.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">5. MARKET INFLUENCE AND TRADING PATTERN EXPECTATION</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          Promotional campaigns commonly result in short-lived spikes in stock price and volume, followed by rapid declines. These spikes are typically driven by retail speculation, promotional circulation, and momentary investor interest—not fundamentals. You should expect that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc text-base text-primaryText space-y-3 font-inter">
          <li>CVKD’s stock may increase temporarily during this promotion,</li>
          <li>Trading volume may rise sharply, and</li>
          <li>The price may fall after the campaign ends or selling begins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          These patterns are typical of stock promotions, and you should proceed accordingly.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">6. NO RELIANCE – INVESTOR RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          The burden of research, investigation, and risk assessment rests solely with you. Relqo Media LLC is not responsible for your investment decisions. You are strongly urged to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc text-base text-primaryText space-y-3 font-inter">
          <li>Read public filings from the SEC,</li>
          <li>Consult a licensed financial adviser,</li>
          <li>Understand risks such as dilution, insider selling, and volatility, and</li>
          <li>Recognize that speculative stocks often lack financial transparency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base text-primaryText font-inter">
          We accept no responsibility for losses incurred due to actions taken based on our Communications.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mt-8 text-primaryText text-xl font-inter font-medium">7. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND SAFE HARBOR</h4>
