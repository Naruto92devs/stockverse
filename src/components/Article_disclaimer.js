                  <p className="text-base text-primaryText">Relqo Media LLC is compensated for its promotional services by Penzance LLC, and this compensation may include cash payments, stock options, or other financial consideration from the companies we feature. The compensation received directly impacts the content presented on our platforms and creates a significant conflict of interest.</p>

Therefore, this communication should be viewed as a commercial advertisement only.</p>
                  <p className="text-base text-primaryText">We have not investigated the background of the hiring third party or parties. The third party, profiled company, or their affiliates may wish to liquidate shares of the profiled company at or near the time you receive this communication, which could negatively impact share prices. Any non-compensated alerts are purely for the purpose of expanding our database for future financially compensated investor relations efforts. Frequently, companies profiled in our alerts may experience a significant increase in volume and share price during investor relations marketing, which may decline as soon as the marketing ceases.</p>
